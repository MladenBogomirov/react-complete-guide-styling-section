# Styling

This mini project covers some of the basics of using different styling approaches in a React application

## Overview

The applications is rather simple and minimalistic. It consists of only one input and one button with which the user can add goals. That's because the goal of this course's section is just to explain different approaches developers can use to style their React applications. In addition, the app is prebuilt by the course tutor - Maximilian Schwarzmueller.

## Topics covered in this project

- Setting inline styles and CSS classes
- Using styled components

  - Why and how to use it
  - Dynamic props and how to handle media queries

- Using CSS Modules

  - Differences between styled components and CSS Modules
  - How to use CSS Modules and setting dynamic styles

**:exclamation: NB** For the sake of simplicity and cleaner git history, commits which involve styled-components are ommitted. (Also, I don't like it at all :smile_cat: )
